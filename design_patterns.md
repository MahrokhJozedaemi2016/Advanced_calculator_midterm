## Implementation Status

The project currently supports core arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), includes a history of calculations, implements enhanced error handling, and has a main.py entry point for a user-friendly command-line interface with exception handling. Additionally, a REPL interface has been added for interactive command execution, and a plugin system enables dynamic command integration. All features adhere to design principles such as SOLID, DRY, and Separation of Concerns.

### Design Patterns Applied So Far

1. **Command Pattern**:
   **.Purpose**: Encapsulates each arithmetic operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide) as a command, allowing for easy addition o   f new operations.
   **.Aplication**: Each arithmetic command inherits from a Command base class, ensuring a consistent interface. The Calculator clas   s uses these commands, promoting clean separation of concerns and enabling easy extensibility.
   
2. **Plugin System with Factory Pattern**
   **.Purpose**: Provides a flexible structure to dynamically load and integrate new commands without modifying the core application   code.
   **.Application**: Each plugin represents a separate command that can be dynamically imported into the Calculator through the load   _plugin method. This follows the Factory Pattern, where the Calculator acts as a factory that produces command objects based on t   he loaded plugins.

3. **Encapsulation and Modular Design**
   **.Purpose**: Segregates different aspects of functionality into specific modules, following the principles of modularity and enc   apsulation.
   **.Application**: 
   - The Calculator class encapsulates command execution and history management.
   - The Calculations class manages the history of calculations, isolating history operations from arithmetic logic.
   - The main.py file provides a single entry point to the program, encapsulating REPL interactions and exception handling.

4. **Parameterized Testing**
   **.Purpose**: Enhances testing scalability and robustness through dynamic test generation.
   **Application**: Using conftest.py, parameterized testing is integrated with the pytest framework, allowing tests to dynamically    generate test cases with Faker. This approach ensures a diverse set of test cases and maintains code scalability.

5. **Error Handling and Input Validation**
   **.Purpose**:Ensures the robustness of the REPL by handling various types of user errors (e.g., invalid numbers, division by zero   ,unknown operations).
   **.Applicatiom**:Error handling is encapsulated within the main.py REPL interface, promoting modularity and separation of concern   s by isolating exception management in a centralized location.

## Planned Patterns

**Facade Pattern**
**.Purpose**:Simplify interactions with complex data handling, especially as additional data management features (such as using Pandas for history operations) are introduced.
**Future application**: This pattern will provide a simplified interface for complex data interactions, making the user-facing code cleaner and easier to maintain.

**Singleton Pattern**
**.Purpose**:Manage global configurations, particularly when logging or environment-specific settings are implemented.
**.Future application**:This pattern will ensure that only one instance of a configuration object exists, maintaining consistency across the application.

**Strategy Pattern**
**.Purpose**:Allow different algorithms or strategies for handling specific calculations or data management tasks.
**.Future application**:This pattern will enable users to select between different strategies, such as basic calculations or extended statistical functions.

Detailed descriptions and code examples for each additional pattern will be added as they are implemented in future steps.
