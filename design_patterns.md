## Implementation Status

The project currently supports core arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), manages a robust history of calculations, and provides a user-friendly REPL command-line interface with error handling. Recent updates include an enhanced calculation history feature, allowing users to load, save, clear, and delete history records using Pandas. The projectâ€™s architecture follows fundamental design principles, such as SOLID, DRY, and Separation of Concerns, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

### Design Patterns Applied So Far

1. **Command Pattern**:
   **Purpose**: Encapsulates each arithmetic operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide) as a command, allowing for easy addition o   f new operations.
   **.Aplication**: Each arithmetic command inherits from a Command base class, ensuring a consistent interface. The Calculator clas   s uses these commands, promoting clean separation of concerns and enabling easy extensibility.
   
2. **Plugin System with Factory Pattern**
   **Purpose**: Provides a flexible structure to dynamically load and integrate new commands without modifying the core application code
   **Application**: Each plugin represents a separate command dynamically imported into the Calculator through the load_plugin method. This follows the Factory Pattern, where the Calculator acts as a factory that produces command objects based on the loaded plugins, enabling modular expansion.

3. **Facade Pattern**
**Purpose**:Simplifies interactions with complex data handling, especially with additional data management features introduced in this step, such as using Pandas for history operations.
**Application**:The Calculations class acts as a Facade for the history management, offering a simplified interface for storing, loading, saving, and deleting calculation records. This implementation isolates Pandas-specific code within the class, making the interface cleaner and easier to use.


4. **Encapsulation and Modular Design**
   **Purpose**: Segregates different aspects of functionality into specific modules, following principles of modularity and encapsulation.
   **Application**: 
   - The Calculator class encapsulates command execution and history management.
   - The Calculations class manages the history of calculations, isolating history operations from arithmetic logic.
   - The main.py file provides a single entry point to the program, encapsulating REPL interactions and exception handling.

5. **Parameterized Testing**
   **Purpose**: Enhances testing scalability and robustness through dynamic test generation.
   **Application**: Using conftest.py, parameterized testing is integrated with the pytest framework, allowing tests to dynamically generate test cases with Faker. This approach ensures a diverse set of test cases, making testing more comprehensive and adaptable to future changes.

6. **Error Handling and Input Validation**
   **Purpose**:nsures the robustness of the REPL by handling various types of user errors (e.g., invalid numbers, division by zero, unknown operations).
   **.Applicatiom**:Error handling is encapsulated within the main.py REPL interface, promoting modularity and separation of concerns by isolating exception management in a centralized location.

## Planned Patterns

**Singleton Pattern**
**.Purpose**:Manage global configurations, particularly when logging or environment-specific settings are implemented.
**.Future application**:This pattern will ensure that only one instance of a configuration object exists, maintaining consistency across the application.

**Strategy Pattern**
**.Purpose**:Allow different algorithms or strategies for handling specific calculations or data management tasks.
**.Future application**:This pattern will enable users to select between different strategies, such as basic calculations or extended statistical functions.

Detailed descriptions and code examples for each additional pattern will be added as they are implemented in future steps. This documentation will continue to evolve as more patterns are applied to improve functionality and maintainability.
