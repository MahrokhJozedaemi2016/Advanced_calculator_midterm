## Implementation Status

The project currently supports core arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), includes a history of calculations, and implements enhanced error handling. Additionally, the `Faker` library has been integrated to generate random test data, and a `main.py` entry point provides a user-friendly command-line interface with exception handling. All features are implemented in line with design principles such as SOLID, DRY, and Separation of Concerns.

### Design Patterns Applied So Far

1. **Encapsulation and Modular Design**:
   - Each arithmetic operation is encapsulated within a dedicated function, and operations are performed via the `Calculator` class.
   - The `Calculations` class manages the history of calculations, ensuring that history management is separate from the operation logic.
   - The `main.py` file provides a single entry point to the program, encapsulating command-line interactions and exception handling.

2. **Parameterized Testing**:
   - Using `conftest.py`, we integrated parameterized testing with the `pytest` framework. This setup allows for dynamically generated test cases using `Faker` for random data, promoting scalability in testing and ensuring the robustness of the application.
   
3. **Error Handling and Input Validation**:
   - The main program is structured to handle various user input errors (such as division by zero, invalid numbers, and unknown operations) with appropriate error messages. This approach follows the design principles of encapsulation and modularity by isolating error handling within the `main.py` entry point.

### Planned Patterns

- **Command Pattern**: Future updates will incorporate the Command Pattern within a REPL interface, allowing each arithmetic operation to be encapsulated as a command.
- **Facade Pattern**: Once data handling with Pandas is introduced, the Facade Pattern will simplify complex interactions.
- **Singleton Pattern**: This may be applied for configuration management, particularly for global settings such as logging.
- **Factory Method and Strategy Patterns**: These patterns will facilitate flexibility in the creation and execution of operations, supporting advanced functionality and user-defined commands.

Detailed descriptions and code examples for each pattern will be added as they are implemented in future steps.
